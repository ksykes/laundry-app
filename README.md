# HackerYou Project 6 â€” Web Application using React

## Project Brief

For this project we would like you to create a Web Application using React. This will call on all that you have learned up till now! Using the React library we would like you to create an interactive application.

Your data should come from and API or be generated with Firebase. If you want to take it a step further, consider including React Router and/or authentication via Firebase! Just like all of the other projects, this one needs to be responsive so that users can view it on any screen!

### Project Proposals

A key component of managing any web application is managing scope. Once you come up with your project idea, you will be required to pitch it to us. This pitch should include an outline of the functionality that your app will offer users, as well as some extra 'nice-to-haves' you plan to add if you have extra time.

We want to hear why you feel like what you've learned so far about React and Firebase will prepare you to successfully execute this project, and meeting with us and pitching your app will help us make sure that you're on the right track.

### Deployment

In order to make deploying your app easy use the Firebase hosting features to get your site up online! There is the ability to add a custom domain if you would like, so think about a fun, shareable domain for your application!
