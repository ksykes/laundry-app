# The Laundry Mentor

## Project Brief

The requirements for this project were to create an interactive web application using React. This app allows users to select a laundry icon found on a clothing item to read its instructions. The map uses geolocation to show the closest laundromat's to the user's location. Users can also view two separate pages, created using React Router, which will give more tips and problem-solving for doing their laundry.
